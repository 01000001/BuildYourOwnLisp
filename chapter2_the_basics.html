<h2>Compiler &amp; Text Editor</h2>

<p>Before getting started programming C you'll have to install a <strong>compiler</strong> and a <strong>text editor</strong>.</p>

<p>The compiler is what transforms the C source code into a program your computer can run. A text editor will allow you to edit text files in a way suitable for programming.</p>

<p>The installation process for these is different depending on what operating system you are running.</p>

<p>Compiling and running C programs is also going to make use of the command line. For this, and the rest of the book, I am going to assume you are familiar with using the command line. If you are not familiar then search online for information on using it, relevant to your operating system.</p>

<h3>Linux</h3>

<p>On Linux systems to install a C compiler you will have to download some packages. If you are running Ubuntu or Debian you can install everything you need with the following command.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install build-essential</code></pre>

<p>If you are running Fedora or a similar Linux variant you can use this command.<p>

<pre><code>su -c "yum groupinstall development-tools"</code></pre>

<p>For a text editor I recommend using <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/">gedit</a> or whatever other basic text editor comes installed with your distribution. If you are a Vim or Emacs user these are also fine. Please don't use an IDE. It isn't required for such a small project and wont help in understanding what is going on.</p>

<h3>Mac</h3>

<p>If you are on Mac OSX then you should install the latest version of XCode from Apple. This could take a long time as typically XCode is a big peice of software to install. If you are unsure of how to do this you can search online for "installing xcode" and follow any advice shown. You may also have to install the XCode command line tools in a separate package.</p>

<p>Once XCode is installed you should have access to a C compiler from the command line and be ready to go.</p>

<p>A simple text editor that can be used on Mac is <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">TextWrangler</a>. If you have a different preference this is fine. Please don't use XCode for text editing as this is a small project and using an IDE wont help you understand what is going on.</p>

<h3>Windows</h3>

<p>On windows I recommend downloading and installing <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a>. This will install a C compiler and allow you to run it from the command line <code>cmd.exe</code>. It will create programs ending in the <code>.exe</code> suffix which should be run by using their full name without the leading <code>./</code>.</p>

<p>My text editor of choice on windows is <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>. If you have another preference this is fine. Please <em>don't</em> use <em>Visual Studio</em> as it does not have proper support for C programming. It you attempt to use it you will run into many problems.</p>

<h3>Testing</h3>

<p>To test if your C compiler is installed correctly type the following into the command line.<p>

<pre><code>$ cc --version
  cc (rubenvb-4.7.2-release) 4.7.2
  ...</code></pre>

<p>If you get something like the following echoed back, then your C compiler is installed correctly and you are ready to go!</p>

<p>Don't include the <code>$</code> sign! This is simply used to indicate this command should be run from the command line.</p>


<h2>Hello World</h2>

<p>Now that your environment is set up, start by opening your text editor and inputting the following code. Create a directory where you are going to work on this book and save this file as <code>hello_world.c</code>. This is your first C program!</p>

<pre><code class="lang-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  puts(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
  return 0;
}</code></pre>

-->

<p>Depending on your programming experience this may look like a lot of crazy symbols that make very little sense. I'll try to explain it step by step.</p>

<p>In the first line we <em>include</em> what is called a <em>header</em>. This statement allows us to use the functions from <code>stdio.h</code>, the standard input and output library which comes included with C. One of these is the <code>puts</code> function you see later on in the program.</p>

<p>Next we declare a function called <code>main</code>. This function is declared to <em>return</em> an <code>int</code>, and <em>take as input</em> an <code>int</code> called <code>argc</code> and a <code>char**</code> called <code>argv</code>. All C programs must contain this function. It acts as the entry point to execution. When you run a C program it always starts at <code>main</code> and continues from there.</p>

<p>For now don&#39;t worry about the inputs <code>argc</code> and <code>argv</code>. We will cover those in later chapters.</p>

<p>Inside <code>main</code> we see the line <code>puts(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);</code>. This is a call to the function <code>puts</code>, which outputs <code>Hello, world!</code> to the command line. The function <code>puts</code> stands for <em>put string</em>.</p>

<p>Finally we see <code>return 0;</code>. This tells the <code>main</code> function to finish and return <code>0</code>. When a C program returns <code>0</code> this indicates there have been no errors running the program.</p>


<h2>Compilation</h2>

<p>Before we can run this program we need to compile it. This will produce the actual <em>executable</em> we can run on our computer. Open up a terminal and browse to the directory that <code>hello_world.c</code> is saved in. Compile you program using the following command.</p>

<pre><code>$ cc -std=c99 -Wall hello_world.c -lm -o hello_world</code></pre>

<p>This compiles the code in <code>hello_world.c</code>, reporting any warnings <code>-Wall</code>, and outputs <code>-o</code> the program to a new file <code>hello_world</code>.</p>

<p>If successful you should see the output file in the current directory. This can be run by typing <code>./hello_world</code> (or <code>hello_world.exe</code> on windows). If all goes to plan you should see a friendly <code>Hello, world!</code> message appear as output.</p>

<p><strong>Congratulations!</strong> You've just compiled and run your first C program.</p>


<h2>Compiler Errors</h2>

<p>If there are some problems with your C program the compilation process may fail. These issues can range from simple syntax errors, to other complicated problems that are hard to understand.</p>

<p>Sometimes the error message from the compiler will make sense, but if you are having trouble understanding it try searching online for it. You should see if you can find a concise explaination of what it means, and work out how to correct it. Remember this: there are many people before you who have struggled with exactly the same problems.</p>

<p>Sometimes there will be many compiler errors stemming from one source. Always work through compiler errors from first to last.</p>


<h2>Runtime Errors</h2>

<p>Sometimes the compiler will compile a program, but when you run it it will crash. Debugging C programs in this situation is hard. It can be an art far beyond the scope of this book. But it still needs to be done.<p>

  <p><small>Rage &bull; A poor debugging technique</small></p>
</div>

<p>My first port of call for debugging a crashing C program is to print out lots of information as the program is running. Using this method I can try to isolate exactly what part of the code is incorrect and what, if anything, is going wrong up until the crash. For beginners I would recommend this technique. It is <em>active</em> debugging - which is the important thing. As long as you are doing <em>something</em>, the process is less painful and the temptation to give up is lessened.<p>

<p>For people feeling more confident a program called <code>gdb</code> can be used to debug your C programs. This can be difficult and complicated to use, but it is also very powerful and can give you extremely valuable information and what went wrong and where. Information on how to use <code>gdb</code> can be found online.</p>

<p>For those using Linux <code>valgrind</code> can be used to aid the debugging of memory leaks and other more nasty errors. Valgrind is a tool that can save you hours, or even days, of debugging. It does not take much to get proficient at it, so investigating it is highly recommended. Again information on how to use it can be found online.</p>


<h2>Reference Documentation</h2>

<p>If you spot a C function in some example code that you don't recognize you might wonder what it does. In this case you will want to look toward the <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/c">reference documentation</a>, which explains all the functions included in the C standard library.</p>

<h2>Bonus Marks</h2>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <p><strong>What is this section for?</strong></p>

  <p>In this subsection I'll list some things to try for fun, and learning.</p>

  <p>It is good if you can attempt to do some of these challenges. Some will be easy, while some will be very difficult. For this reason don&#39;t worry if you can&#39;t figure them all out. Some might not even be possible!</p>

  <p>Many will require some research on the internet. This is an integral part of learning a new language so should not be avoided. The ability to teach yourself things is one of the most valuable skills in programming.</p>
