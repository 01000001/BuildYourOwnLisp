<p>You may come from a programming background, or one with no experience at all. To get everyone on the same page, I've prepared quick overview of the basic features of C. This wont be an in depth explaination, but more of a cheat-sheet.</p>

<p>This chapter should be considered a reference to look back upon if things are unclear in later chapters. There is a lot to take in here so feel free to skim it and and revised the contents later if things become unclear.</p>


<h2>Program Structure</h2>

<p>C programs are structured very simply. They only consist only of <em>function definitions</em> and <em>structure definitions</em>. This means a C source file is simply a list of functions and data types. These functions can call each other or themselves, and use the data types declared.</p>

<p>It is also possible to call other libraries of functions, or use their data types.</p>

<p>As we saw in the previous chapter, the actual execution of a C program starts in the function called <code>main</code> and calls other functions to do more complicated processing.</p>


<h2>Variables &amp; Types</h2>

<p>Every variable in C has an explicit <em>type</em>. As well as being able to define our own data types, some native types are built into C. Here is a few of them with some basic descriptions.</p>

<table class="table">
  <tr><td><code>void</code></td>  <td>Empty Type</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>char</code></td>  <td>Single Character/Byte</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>int</code></td>   <td>Integer</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>long</code></td>  <td>Integer that can hold larger values</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>float</code></td> <td>Decimal Number</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>double</code></td><td>Decimal Number with more precision</td></tr>
</table>

<p>We declare a new variable by writting the type name then the variable name, and optionally setting it to some value. For example to create a new <code>int</code> called <code>count</code> we could write the following inside a function.</p> 

<pre><code data-language='C'>int count;</code></pre>

<p>or to declare it and set the value</p>

<pre><code data-language='C'>int count = 10;</code></pre>


<h2>Functions</h2>

<p>To declare a function in C, one writes the name of the type it returns, the name of the function, and then in parenthesis a list of arguments/inputs to this function separated by commas. Each argument is a type name and a variable name.</p>

<p>The contents of the function is put inside curly brackets <code>{}</code>, and lists all of the statements the function executes, terminated by semicolons <code>;</code>. A <code>return</code> statement is used to let the function end and output a value.</p>

<p>For example a function that takes two <code>int</code> variables called <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> and adds them together could look like this.</p>

<pre><code data-language='C'>int add_together(int x, int y) {
  int result = x + y;
  return result;
}</code></pre>


<h2>Structs</h2>

<p>To declare our own types we can use the <code>struct</code> keyword in conjunction with the <code>typedef</code> keyword.</p>

<p>Structs are like several C variables bundled together in a single package. We could create a struct called <code>point</code> that represents a point in 2D space by packaging together two <code>float</code> (decimal) values called <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>. It would look like this.</p>

<pre><code data-language='C'>typedef struct {
  float x;
  float y;
} point;</code></pre>

<p>We should place this at the top of our source file so it becomes avaliable to use as a type for our functions. As a type it is no different to the native types and so we can use it in all the same ways. We can access each individual field using a dot <code>.</code>, followed by the field name such as <code>x</code>.</p>

<pre><code data-language='C'>point p;
p.x = 0.1;
p.y = 10.0;
</code></pre>

<h2>Pointers</h2>

<p>A pointer is a variation on a normal type where the type name is suffixed with a asterix <code>*</code>, for example <code>int*</code>. These are a difficult part of C and will be explained in much greater detail in later chapters. For now it is good to simply know they exist, and how to spot them. They can be used in a number of different ways such as for strings and lists.</p>

<p>We'll see all of these uses in later chapters, where I'll explain everything greater depth. For now just don't let them scare you off.</p>


<h2>Strings</h2>

<p>Strings in C use the pointer type <code>char*</code>. Under the hood they are a list of bytes terminated by a special byte called the <em>null terminator</em>. Strings are a complicated, but integral and important part of C, which we'll learn to use effectively.</p>

<p>They can also be declared literally by putting text between quotation <code>"</code> marks, for example <code>"Hello, World!"</code>.</p>

<p>Just remember that if you see <code>char*</code>, you should read it as <em>string</em>.</p> 


<h2>Conditionals</h2>

<p>To perform code under some condition we can use the <code>if</code> statement. It is written as <code>if</code> followed by some condition in parenthesis <code>()</code>, followed by the code to execute in curly brackets <code>{}</code>. An <code>if</code> statement can be followed by an optional <code>else</code> followed by more statements in curly brackets <code>{}</code>. This code will be performed in the case the conditional statement is not true.</p>

<p>For example if we wish to check if an <code>int</code> called <code>x</code> is greater than <code>10</code> or not we might write the following.</p> 

<pre><code data-language='C'>if (x > 10) {
  puts("x is 0!");
} else {
  puts("x is not 0!");
}</code></pre>

<p>Inside a conditional any value that is not <code>0</code> will evaluate to true. This is important to remember as many conditions use this to check something implicitly.</p>


<h2>Loops</h2>

<p>There are two main loops in C.</p>

<p>The first is a <code>while</code> loop. This loop repeatedly executes a block of code until some condition becomes false. It is written as <code>while</code> followed by some condition in parenthesis <code>()</code>, followed by the code to execute in curly brackets <code>{}</code>. For example a loop that counts downward from <code>10</code> to <code>1</code> could be written as follows.</p>

<pre><code data-language='C'>int i = 10;
while (i > 0) {
  puts("Loop Iteration");
  i = i - 1;
}</code></pre>

<p>The secon kind of loop in C is a <code>for</code> loop. Rather than a condition this loop contains three statements separated by semicolons <code>;</code>. These are an <em>initialiser</em>, a <em>condition</em> and an <em>incrementer</em>. The <em>initaliser</em> is performed before the loop starts, the <em>condition</em> is checked at the end of each iteration of the loop, and if false the loop is exited. The <em>incrementer</em> is performed before the next iteration of the loop.</p>

<p>For example to write a loop that counts up from <code>0</code> to <code>9</code> we might write the following. In this case the <code>++</code> operator increments the variable <code>i</code>.</p>

<pre><code data-language='C'>for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  puts("Loop Iteration");
}</code></pre>

<p>Notice how this is more compact than the <code>while</code> loop for counting. This is often what it is used for.</p>
