<h2>What is a Programming Language?</h2> <hr/>

<p>A programming language is very similar to a real language. There is a structure behind it, and some rules which dictate what is, and isn't, a valid thing to say. When we read and write natural language, we are unconciously learning these rules, and the same is true for programming languages. We can utilise these rules to understand others, and generate our own speech, or code.</p>

<p>In the 1950s the linguist <em>Noam Chomsky</em> formalised a number of important observations about languages. Many of these form the basis of our understanding of language today. One of these was the observation that natural languages are built up of recursive and repeated substructures.</p>

<p>As an example of this, we can examine the phrase <code>The cat is black</code>.</p>

<p>The adjective <code>black</code> can be replaced by two adjectives conjoined with <em>and</em>; for example <code>The cat is black and white</code>.</p>

<p>Each of these new adjectives can in turn be replaced by further specification and variation. We can expand it to <code>the cat is jet black and a pale white</code>.</p>

<p>This behaviour happens in programming languages too. The body of an <code>if</code> statement can contain any number of new statements. One of these new statements could itself be another <code>if</code> statement, and so on.</p>

<p>The consequence of this observation is important. It means that although there is an infinite number of different things that can be said, or written down, in a particular language; it is still possible to process and understand it with a finite number of rules.</p>

<p>The name for these rules is a <em>grammar</em>. We can describe grammers in a number of ways. One way is textual. For example we could say, "a <em>sentance</em> must contain a <em>verb phrase</em>", or "a <em>verb phrase</em> can be either a <em>verb</em> or an <em>adverb</em> followed by a <em>verb phrase</em>". This method is good for humans but it is too vague for computers to understand. When programming we need to write down a more formal description of a grammar.</p>

<p>We are going to do this for our Lisp. To be able to read in the user input we need to write a <em>grammar</em> which describes it. If we write this grammar we can use it along with our user input and decide if the input is valid. If it is valid we can build a structured internal representation, which we can then <em>evaluate</em>, and perform the commands encoded within.</p>

<p>This is where <code>mpc</code> comes in.</p>


<h2>Parser Combinators</h2> <hr/>

<p><code>mpc</code> is a <em>Parser Combinator</em> library written by yours truely. It is a library that allows you to build <em>parsers</em>, programs that understand and process particular languages. There are many different ways of building parsers, but the nice thing about using a <em>Parser Combinator</em> library is that it lets you build <em>parsers</em> easily, by specifying just the <em>grammar</em> ... sort of.</p>

<p>Many <em>Parser Combinator</em> libraries actually work by letting you write normal code that simply <em>looks like</em> a grammar, not by actually specifying the grammar itself. Often this is the best that can be done, but luckily for us <code>mpc</code> allows for both. It can let us write normal code that just <em>looks like</em> a grammar, or we can use special notation to write a grammar naturally.</p>


<h2>Coding Grammars</h2> <hr/>

<p>So what does code that <em>looks like</em> a grammar..<em>look like</em>? Here is a basic example of using <code>mpc</code> in this mode.</p>

<pre><code data-language='c'>/* Build a new parser 'Flatmate' */
mpc_parser_t* Flatmate = mpc_or(4, 
  mpc_sym("Dan"),  mpc_sym("Chess"),
  mpc_sym("Adam"), mpc_sym("Lewis")
);

/* Do some parsing... */

mpc_delete(Flatmate);
</code></pre>

<p>What this code does is create a new parser, which could be used to parse some input. The parser would parse <em>either</em> <code>"Dan"</code>, <code>"Chess"</code>, <code>"Adam"</code> <em>or</em> <code>"Lewis"</code>. These are all the strings that can be successfully recognized by this parser, and so they are considered its <em>language</em>.If you squint your eyes you could attempt to read the first section of the code like it is a weird grammar. It goes like this: "a <em>Flatmate</em> is <code>"Dan"</code> or <code>"Chess"</code> or <code>"Adam"</code> or <code>"Lewis"</code>".</p>

<p>We can built a more complicated parser by referencing existing ones. In the next example the parser <code>Greet</code> parses <code>&quot;Hello&quot;</code> followed by a <code>Flatmate</code> (<em>either</em> <code>"Dan"</code>, <code>"Chess"</code>, <code>"Adam"</code> <em>or</em> <code>"Lewis"</code>), and concatinates these two results together using the function <code>mpcf_strfold</code>.</p>

<p>The parser <code>Greetings</code> then expands on this by recognizing many (zero or more) occurrences of <code>Greet</code> parser and concatinating them with the function <code>mpcf_strfold</code>.</p>

<pre><code data-language='c'>mpc_parser_t* Greet = mpc_and(2, mpcf_strfold,
  mpc_sym(&quot;Hello&quot;),
  Flatmate, 
  free); 

mpc_parser_t* Greetings = mpc_many(mpcf_strfold, Greet);</code></pre>

<p>There are an infinite number of different possible strings that could be accepted by our <code>Greetings</code> parser. This means it's language is <em>infinite</em>. Here are some examples of possible strings <code>Greetings</code> could accept.

<pre><code data-language='c'>&quot;Hello Dan&quot;
&quot;Hello Dan Hello Chess&quot;
&quot;Hello Lewis Hello Lewis Hello Lewis&quot;</code></pre>

</p> Again we can squint our eyes and try to read the above code as if it were a grammar. "A <em>Greet</em>, is <code>"Hello"</code>, <em>and</em> a <em>Flatmate</em>, joined using <code>mpcf_strfold</code>", "a <em>Greetings</em> is many <em>Greet</em>s joined using <code>mpcf_strfold</code>".</p>

<p>If we use more functions and structures, we can slowly build up a parsers that parse more and more complicated languages. The code we use <em>sort of</em> looks like a grammar. This isn&#39;t always an easy task but there are a whole set of helper functions that build on simple constructs to make frequent tasks easy. These are all documented on the <a href="http://github.com/orangeduck/mpc">mpc repository</a>. This is a good approach for complicated languages, as it allows for fine-grained control.</p>


<h2>Natural Grammars</h2> <hr/>

<p><code>mpc</code> lets us write grammars in a more natural form too. Rather than using C functions that look a little like a grammar, we can specify the whole thing in one long string. When using this method you don&#39;t have to worry about how to join or discard inputs, with functions such as <code>mpcf_strfold</code>, or <code>free</code>. All of that is done automatically for us</p>

<p>This makes it a much easier approach. Here is how we would recreate the previous examples using this method.</p>

<pre><code data-language='c'>mpc_parser_t* Flatmate  = mpc_new(&quot;flatmate&quot;);
mpc_parser_t* Greet     = mpc_new(&quot;greet&quot;);
mpc_parser_t* Greetings = mpc_new(&quot;greetings&quot;);

mpca_lang(
  &quot;                                                            \
    flatmate  : \&quot;Chess\&quot; | \&quot;Dan\&quot; | \&quot;Adam\&quot; | \&quot;Lewis\&quot;;    \
    greet     : \&quot;Hello\&quot; &lt;flatmate&gt;;                          \
    greetings : &lt;greet&gt;*;                                      \
  &quot;,
  Flatmate, Greet, Greetings);

/* Do some parsing... */

mpc_cleanup(3, Flatmate, Greet, Greetings);</code></pre>

<p>Without having a good understanding of what is going on, it should be obvious how much <em>clearer</em> the grammar is in this format. If we learn what all the special symbols mean we barely have to squint our eyes to read it.</p>

<p>Another thing to notice is that the process is now in two steps. First we create and name several rules using <code>mpc_new</code> and then we define them using <code>mpca_lang</code>.</p>

<p>The first argument to <code>mpca_lang</code> is a long multi-line string in C. This is the formal <em>grammar</em> specification we&#39;ve heard so much about. It consists of a number of <em>rules</em>. Each rule has the name of a parser on the left, a colon <code>:</code>, and on the right it&#39;s definition terminated with a semicolon <code>;</code>. The special symbols used to define the parsers work as follows.</p>

<table class='table'>
  <tr><td><code>"ab"</code></td><td>A string <code>ab</code> is required.</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>'a'</code></td><td>A character <code>a</code> is required.</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>'a' 'b'</code></td><td>First <code>'a'</code> is required, then <code>'b'</code> is required..</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>'a' | 'b'</code></td><td>Either <code>'a'</code> is required, or <code>'b'</code> is required.</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>'a'*</code></td><td>Zero or more <code>'a'</code> are required.</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>'a'+</code></td><td>One or more <code>'a'</code> are required.</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>&lt;abba&gt;</code></td><td>The rule called <code>abba</code> is required.</td></tr>
</table>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <p><strong>Sounds familiar...</strong></p>

  <p>Did you notice that the description of what the input string to <code>mpca_lang</code> should look like sort of sounded like I was specifying a grammar? That&#39;s because it was! <code>mpc</code> actually uses itself internally to parse the input you give it to <code>mpca_lang</code>. It does it by specifying a <em>grammar</em> in code using the previous method. How neat is that..</p>
</div>

<p>This method of specifying a grammar is what we are going to use in the following chapters. It might seem overwhelming at first. Grammars can be difficult to understand right away. But as we continue you will become much more familar with how to create and edit them.</p>
