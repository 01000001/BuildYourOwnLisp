<p>In just a few lines of code, I'll teach you how to effectively use C, and what it takes to start building your own language.</p>

<p>Along the way we'll learn about the weird and wonderful nature of Lisps, and what really makes a programming language. By building a <em>real world</em> C program we'll learn implicit things that conventional books cannot teach.
