<p>If you're looking to learn C, or you've ever wondered how to build your own programming language, this is the book for you.</p>

<p>In a handful of pages, and just a few lines of code, I'll teach you how to effectively use C, and what it takes to start building your own language.</p>

<p>Along the way we'll learn about the weird and wonderful nature of Lisps, and what a language really is. We'll also learn things conventional books can't teach you, such as how to structure a program and write beautiful code.</p>
